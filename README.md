Concurrent Boids implementation in golang
=========================================

This is an implementation of [Boids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids) written in golang. Each boid update runs in a goroutine, allowing for concurrent updates.

Warning: this was written while learning golang, so this code is likely to contain ugly.
